# DragonFable Private Server 2024 [WIP]

### Patched files:

- /web/DFLoader-patched.swf: Added ability to change the gamefiles path + server path
- /another-server/cdn/custom-gamefiles-path/game15_8_05-patched.swf: Match server path from DFLoader-patched.swf

### To do:

- [ ] Fix cf-dacheck.asp from swf, to match the server path. Search by terms like http://dragonfable.battleon.com/game/cf-dacheck.asp
- [ ] Define custom DFversion.txt file from html page, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4671867/how-do-i-access-flashvars-in-as3-and-add-them-to-an-existing-text-field
- [ ] Fix character page redirecting to the original server
